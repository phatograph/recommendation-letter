I hereby wish to recommend Mr. Phattara Wangrungarun for the `Scholarship`. I have known and worked alongside with Mr. Phattara for the past 2 years during his tenure as an employee of my Company.

He has been and continues to be an exemplary employee, both technically and from a team/mentor perspective. An extremely fast learner, Phattara has been instrumental in leading complex technical projects whilst also mentoring newer team members. He shows a strong ability to adapt to new technologies and methodologies and has continually demonstrated strong problem solving, collaborative and cognitive skills.

During his time with us he has completed a number of internal and client projects, one recent example was an intelligent bot within the company chat system for helping company employees with day-to-day tasks, which is now used continually by all of our employees.

Aside from pure technical skill, Phattara has always been an enthusiastic team player and an ambassador for the company at several technical events.

I have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending Mr. Phattara for the `Scholarship`.
