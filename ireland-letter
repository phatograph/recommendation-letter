To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Phattara Wangrungaarun. I am a 26 years old web developer from Bangkok, Thailand.
I was graduated from Chulalongkorn University in 2009 majoring in Computer Science.
It has been a while since my bachelor graduation, but I think it’s a good time
to do a Master degree right now.

After graduated I have been working in Software development field for almost 5 years straight.
My main role is to create a website. I have been though several companies,
had wonderful experience and grew up. Still I’m totally happy working in this career.

My family has always said that they wish me to study aboard, and it is also my dream
to live aboard too. So about the late of last year I gathered my courage and guts
to take an English exam. Fortunately it went well so then I began looking for some scholarships.
I focused on Erasmus Mundus, since I have heard about its reputation of being an outstanding scholarship,
thus I applied for MSc in Dependable Software Systems (DESEM) programme.

I made it to a reserve list of DESEM in March. At that time I also had applied for several more places.
As it came to late June, I think I was not going be awarded DESEM, so I decided to accept an offer
from Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), with partial scholarship included,
then I gone through a student Visa process.

But in early July I finally received an email from DESEM telling that I was offered a place on DESEM.
It was a great moment for me and my family. But I still concern about UK Visa I have already received.
So at the same time with applying for Ireland Visa I will be writing an apologies to QMUL
about the situation that I decided to go to Ireland instead.

As for my travel schedule, I would leave to Ireland at early September, or if I got Visa
at the time in the middle of September I would leave as soon as possible. Right now I’m also
asking NUIM for a campus accommodation.

Best regards,
Phattara Wangrungarun
