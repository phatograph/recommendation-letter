To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Phattara Wangrungaarun. I am a 26-year-old web developer from Bangkok, Thailand.
I graduated from Chulalongkorn University in 2009 majoring in Computer Science.
It has been a while since my bachelor graduation, but I think now would be a good time
to start on my Master's degree.

After my graduation I have been working in software development for almost 5 years straight.
My main field of experience is web development. I have worked for several companies, where I
had wonderful experiences and grew up. I'm still very happy with my career choice.

My family has always said that they want me to study abroad, and it is also my dream
to live abroad. So late last year I gathered my courage and took an English exam. 
Fortunately it went well, so I began looking for some scholarships.
I focused on Erasmus Mundus, since I have heard about its reputation of being an outstanding scholarship program,
thus I applied for MSc in Dependable Software Systems (DESEM) programme.

I made it to a reserve list of DESEM in March. At that time I also had applied for several other places.
In late June I lost hope for receiving my DESEM scholarship, so I decided to accept an offer
from the Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), with partial scholarship included and started the process
of acquiring a student visa.

But in early July I finally received an email from DESEM, sayint that I was offered a place after all.
It was a great moment for me and my family. However, I'm still concerned about the UK visa I have already received.
So at the same time I will be applying for an Irish visa I will be writing a letter of apology to QMUL, explaining my
decision to go to Ireland instead.

As for my travel schedule, I would leave for Ireland early September, or as soon as my visa allows if I haven't received 
it by then. Iâ€™m also currently talking to NUIM for on-campus accommodation.

Best regards,
Phattara Wangrungarun
