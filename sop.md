My first experience with programming was back when
I was in the high school. At the time I had a chance
to write a configuration file for a gaming bot.
It was a fascinated feeling that a program does almost
whatever you told it to do, and the way you fix
or improve your configuration to solve problems
was also challenging. These impressed me in computer programming,
thus I enrolled to the Computer Science major of Chulalongkorn University,
and was graduated with second class honour in academic year 2008.

For early academic years it turned out that I performed well
in mathametics-related fields like *Mathematical Models and Reasoning*
or *Discrete Mathematics*, and also in computer fundamental subjects
like *Data Structures and Algorithms* or *Theory of Computation*
or even *Programming Language Principles and Processing*.
Later on, from my first impression on robot and automated system,
I decided to focus on more logical subjects such as
*Logic and Functional Programming* or *Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems*,
also *Computer Vision*, which my senior project was related on.
It was a face detection and facial recognition system,
input a face portrait into the system and it results a matching
drawing graphic.

After graduated I have been working as a software developer
for several organizations and teams with different environments.
A huge organization with hundreds of members with a complex system
and a strict workflow, to a small software house with 20 developers
using flexible workflow but delivering high quality products.
As a junior role level, these widen my perspective of software development methodologies,
and strengthen my abilities to become a proper senior or team leader
in any software development firm, or even start my own software house,
this is one of my life's ultimate goals.

###### \* For each section per program below: Explanation of why you have chosen the specific grad school, specific features of the grad program which attract you.

#### [DESEM](http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus_mundus/results_compendia/documents/projects/action_1_master_courses/desem_mc_202.pdf)

Due to I had taken many logical and AI subjects in my bachelor,
I enrolled less in subject in software system development field.
So for the master I decide to focus more on this field.
Combining with my experience, I believe that this would sharpen
my skill to be able to contribute and deliver a robust,
sustainable and dependable software systems.
Therefore I am seeking for a programme like this DESEM.

Having a look through modules available in DESEM,
not only promising software development modules
which I'm eager to take, there are also knowledge based system modules
and specialization/integration modules, such as *Artificial Intelligence Principles*
and *Human Computer Interaction Practice* of UStA,
*Real-Time Systems* of UL and *Interaction Design* of NUIM.
These awaken my nostalgic fondness of automated system.
Together these subjects could help me develop one of my dream projects,
the Traffic Recognition System.

#### [EMMCS](http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus_mundus/results_compendia/documents/projects/action_1_master_courses/2013/cssm_2010_0129.pdf)

In order to become a leading role, whether in an organization
or start up a very own one, I believe one should possess an ability
to solve complex problems and be able to design sustainable systems.
That is why I have found modules taught in Masters Programme
in Complex Systems Science interesting. It's an ideal mixture
of mathematical subjects, which I like and performed well in my bachelor,
and AI-related subjects which initially involved me in this
computer science field.

To participate and be graduated from this programme would undoubtedly make me
exceptional as a problem solver, a decision maker, and a designer
of a quality system. For an example, one of my dream projects,
the Traffic Recognition System.

#### [MSc FT Software Engineering, Queen Mary University of London](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduates/programme/view/60)

Since I took many logical and AI subjects in my bachelor,
I am happy to take a further step by studying deeper in these fields,
along with software management subjects which I consider as requirements
of my future career. Software Engineering of Queen Mary University of London
offers a substantial set of modules, both in advanced program design
and management of software project risk, which definitely suits
my skill, experience, adoration, and career aspect.

Having a look through modules available in this programme,
not only promising software development modules
which I'm eager to take, there are also exceptional modules,
such as *Real-Time and Critical Systems*, *Design for Human Interaction*,
or *Machine Learning*. These awaken my nostalgic fondness of automated system.
Together these subjects could help me develop one of my dream projects,
the Traffic Recognition System.

#### [Computer Science MSc, The University of Nottingham](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/pgstudy/courses/computer-science/computer-science-msc.aspx)

Since I took many logical and AI subjects in my bachelor,
I am happy to take a further step by studying deeper in these fields.
Computer Science MSc of The University of Nottingham
offers a substantial set of modules, both in automated scheduling and planning,
and in interactive systems, which definitely suits
my skill, experience, adoration, and career aspect.

Having a look through modules available in this programme,
there are many exceptional modules I would like to participate,
for example, *Machine Learning*, *Autonomous Robotic Systems*,
or *Selected Topics in Artificial Intelligence*.
These awaken my nostalgic fondness of automated system.
Together these subjects could help me develop one of my dream projects,
the Traffic Recognition System.

###### \* Ending section continues from each section above

My hometown Bangkok has its famous reputation of traffic jamming.
This system would gather pictures of major streets and junctions,
upload them to the cloud, determine status of each section,
and publicly assist people how to avoid bad traffic.
This system could be adapted to many other observe-process-publish
scheme, for example, weather detection.

Finally, upon the completion of my graduate study, there could be 2 major
career paths of my life. First one is to continue being an employee
in an organization, take a senior or leader role and contribute to the team
using both working and academic experience. My degree could also
influence both colleagues and customers that the organization is fully equipped
with good players and be able to deliver outstanding services.

And second one, if I could have enough funding and support,
I would run my own software house, providing a great
software system for my nation, and hopefully, for worldwide level.
