My first experience with programming was back when
I was in the high school. At the time I had a chance
to write a configuration file for a gaming bot.
It was a fascinated feeling that a program could do almost
anything you told it to do, and the way you fix
or improve your configuration to solve problems
was also challenging. This got me interested in computer programming,
thus I enrolled to the Computer Science major of Chulalongkorn University
and graduated with second class honour in academic year 2008.

During my early academic years it turned out that I performed well
in mathametics-related fields like *Mathematical Models and Reasoning*
or *Discrete Mathematics*, and also in computer fundamental subjects
like *Data Structures and Algorithms* or *Theory of Computation*
or even *Programming Language Principles and Processing*.
Following on from my initial interest in robotics and automated systems,
I decided to focus on more logical subjects such as
*Logic and Functional Programming* or *Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems*,
also *Computer Vision*, which formed the basis of my senior project.
It was a face detection and facial recognition system,
input a face portrait into the system and it produced a matching
drawing graphic.

After graduating I have been working as a software developer
for several organizations and teams within different environments.
A huge organization with hundreds of members, a complex system
and a strict workflow, to a small software house with 20 developers
using flexible workflows but delivering high quality products.
As a junior developer, my perspective of software development methodologies has been widened
and consequently strengthened my abilities to become a full senior developer or team leader
in any software development firm, or even start my own software house,
this is one of my life's ultimate goals.

###### \* For each section per program below: Explanation of why you have chosen the specific grad school, specific features of the grad program which attract you.

#### [DESEM](http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus_mundus/results_compendia/documents/projects/action_1_master_courses/desem_mc_202.pdf)

Because I had taken many logical and AI subjects in my bachelor,
I enrolled in fewer subjects in the software system development field, 
so for the master I have decided to focus more on this field.
Combining with my experience, I believe that this would sharpen
my skillset to be able to contribute and deliver robust,
sustainable and dependable software systems.
Therefore I am looking for a programme like DESEM.

Having looked through modules available in DESEM,
not only are there promising software development modules
which I'm eager to take, there are also knowledge based system modules
and specialization/integration modules, such as *Artificial Intelligence Principles*
and *Human Computer Interaction Practice* of UStA,
*Real-Time Systems* of UL and *Interaction Design* of NUIM.
These awaken my nostalgic fondness of automated systems.
Together these subjects could help me develop one of my dream projects,
the Traffic Recognition System.

#### [EMMCS](http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus_mundus/results_compendia/documents/projects/action_1_master_courses/2013/cssm_2010_0129.pdf)

In order to become a leading role, whether in an organization
or a startup of my own, I believe one should possess an ability
to solve complex problems and be able to design sustainable systems.
That is why I have found modules taught in the Masters Programme
in Complex Systems Science interesting. It's an ideal mixture
of mathematical subjects, which I like and performed well in my bachelor,
and AI-related subjects which initially involved me in the
computer science field.

To participate in and graduate from this programme would undoubtedly make me
exceptional as a problem solver, a decision maker, and a designer
of a quality system. For example, one of my dream projects,
the Traffic Recognition System.

#### [MSc FT Software Engineering, Queen Mary University of London](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduates/programme/view/60)

Since I took many logical and AI subjects in my bachelor,
I am happy to take a further step by studying these fields in more depth,
along with software management subjects which I consider requirements
of my future career. Software Engineering at Queen Mary University of London
offers a substantial set of modules, both in advanced program design
and management of software project risk, which definitely suits
my skill, experience and career aspirations.

Having a looked through modules available in this programme,
not only are there promising software development modules
which I'm eager to take, there are also exceptional modules,
such as *Real-Time and Critical Systems*, *Design for Human Interaction*,
or *Machine Learning*. These awaken my nostalgic fondness of automated systems.
Together these subjects could help me develop one of my dream projects,
the Traffic Recognition System.

#### [Computer Science MSc, The University of Nottingham](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/pgstudy/courses/computer-science/computer-science-msc.aspx)

Since I took many logical and AI subjects in my bachelor,
I am keen to take the next step by studying these fields in more depth.
Computer Science MSc at The University of Nottingham
offers a substantial set of modules, both in automated scheduling and planning,
and in interactive systems, which definitely suits
my skill, experience and career aspirations.

Having looked through the modules available in this programme,
there are many exceptional modules I would like to participate in,
for example, *Machine Learning*, *Autonomous Robotic Systems*,
or *Selected Topics in Artificial Intelligence*.
These awaken my nostalgic fondness of automated systems.
Together these subjects could help me develop one of my dream projects,
the Traffic Recognition System.

###### \* Ending section continues from each section above

My hometown Bangkok has a famous reputation for heavy traffic congestion.
This system would gather pictures of major streets and junctions,
upload them to the cloud, determine status of each section,
and publicly assist people on how to avoid bad traffic.
This system could be adapted to many other observe-process-publish
schemes, for example, weather detection.

Finally, upon the completion of my graduate study, there could be 2 major
career paths in my life. First one is to continue being an employee
in an organization, take a senior or leader role and contribute to the team
using both working and academic experience. My degree could also
influence both colleagues and customers so that the organization is fully equipped
with good team members and able to deliver outstanding services.

And second one, if I could raise enough funding and support,
I would run my own software house, providing great
software systems for my nation, and hopefully globally.
